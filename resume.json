    "summary": "Imagine me at eighteen working full-time, but with the head of sales. Batteries were selling well, but the commission system wasn't cutting it. The overhaul was on me, with the only question being when I'd finish it. Extra time was consumed by school, so overtime wasn't realistic.@CR@CRMy solution? Iterate. I got it done, plain and simple, with hard work done smart. And truthfully I never stopped iterating, which is what netted me three years work experience in C#, Swift, Javascript, and Python and a course on track to recieve my degree after four years.",
